# 📌 A/B Testing Project: Axe Repositioning

## Project Overview
This project was conducted for the **Experimental Design & Analysis** class as part of the **Master of Science in Marketing Intelligence** program. The study aimed to measure the impact of new taglines on **brand perception and purchase intent** for **AXE**.

## 🎯 Objective
- Reignite **AXE's** brand relevance among **Gen Z & Millennials**.
- Test three new taglines against the existing tagline (**The New Axe Effect**).
- Understand **brand perception, competitor positioning**, and **purchase intent shifts**.

## 🧪 Experimental Design & Methodology
### **Survey Deployment (Qualtrics)**
- Three **treatment groups**, each exposed to a new tagline:
  1. **AXE the EX** – (Transformation, Reinvention, Breaking Free)
  2. **You’ve Evolved, So Have We** – (Modern Masculinity, Confidence)
  3. **The New Bro Code** – (Brotherhood, Camaraderie, Loyalty)
- **Control group** exposed to the existing tagline (**The New Axe Effect**).
- **Competitor brands** (Old Spice, Dr. Squatch, Harry’s) included for benchmarking.
- **149 respondents** participated in the study.

### **Data Processing & Analysis (R)**
- Cleaned & structured dataset for hypothesis testing.
- Created **composite brand perception scores**.
- Coded **participant segmentation** into treatment & control groups.

### **Statistical Analysis (R)**
- **ANOVA**: Tested differences in brand perception, trust, confidence, and coolness.
- **Regression Analysis**: Measured the relationship between brand perception and purchase intent.
- **Tukey HSD (Post-Hoc Tests)**: Identified significant performance differences between taglines.
- **Interaction Effects**: Examined age as a moderating factor in tagline effectiveness.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Tagline preference did not significantly alter brand perception**.
  - Median brand perception scores were similar across all groups.
  - Simply changing the tagline is not enough to shift brand positioning.
- **Competitor evaluations remained mostly unchanged**.
  - Brand loyalty plays a strong role in consumer perception.
  - "You’ve Evolved" tagline caused the most varied response—some saw competitors more favorably, while others didn’t.
- **Improving Axe’s brand perception does not necessarily decrease competitor ratings**.
  - Axe must create a **stronger differentiation strategy** rather than competing directly.
- **Age did not significantly moderate tagline effectiveness**.
  - Generational preferences did not show strong variation.
  - Suggests that a **universal repositioning strategy** may be more effective.
- **Tagline condition did not strongly influence purchase intent**.
  - No tagline significantly outperformed the control.
  - "You’ve Evolved" showed a slight upward trend, but not statistically significant.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Budget Constraints**: Limited ability to run real-world ad experiments.
- **Sample Size**: 149 respondents provided insights but limited generalizability.
- **Time Constraints**: Could not measure long-term perception shifts.
- **Limited Creative Execution**: Tested taglines in isolation (without visual ads, influencers, or real-life engagement).

## 💡 Managerial Implications & Recommendations
✔ **AXE must reposition beyond just a tagline**—it needs a sophisticated, culturally relevant narrative.  
✔ **Emotional storytelling & brand trust** are stronger drivers of purchase intent than tagline changes.  
✔ **Modern masculinity needs redefinition**—AXE should focus on authentic transformation and confidence (e.g., **Keanu Reeves-style branding**).  
✔ **A differentiated brand identity** (edgier, bolder storytelling) will be more effective in competing with Old Spice & Dr. Squatch.  
✔ **An omnichannel marketing strategy** (ads, influencers, content marketing) will be essential for long-term brand growth.  
✔ **Future testing should validate branding impact** with real-world behavioral data (e.g., actual purchase tracking).
